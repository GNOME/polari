  <title>Chat with somebody on IRC</title>

  <p>You can hold private conversations with other IRC users, outside of the
  public IRC chat rooms.  To start a conversation with another IRC user:</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Click on the name of the person in the channel you would like to start
      a chat with.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Information about the user, including their name and the last time they
      were active in the channel, will appear. Click <gui>Start Conversation</gui> to
      start a private conversation.
      </p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>Another option to start a conversation with a user:</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>In the upper-right hand corner of <app>Polari</app> a number is 
      displayed that shows the total number of users in the chat room.  
      Click on the number.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the name of the user you want to message.  Information about 
      the user, including their name and the last time they were active in 
      the channel, will appear.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Press <gui>Start Conversation</gui> to start a private conversation.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

    <p>A new private conversation will start and a chat room will be created. 
    The chat room will be shown in the left sidebar of <app>Polari</app> 
    with the name of the person you are chatting with.
    </p>
