  <title>Chat with somebody on IRC</title>

  <p>You can hold private conversations with other IRC users, outside of the
  public IRC chat rooms.  To start a conversation with another IRC user:</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>In the upper right hand corner of <app>Polari</app> a number is displayed
      that shows the total number of users in the chat room.  Click on the 
      number.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the name of the user you want to message.  Information about the user,
      including their name and the last time they were active in the channel, will appear.
      Click <gui>Message</gui> to start a private conversation.
      </p>
    </item>
  </steps>
    <p>A new private conversation will start and chat room will be started. The chat room
    will be shown in the left sidebar of <app>Polari</app> with the name of the person
    you are chatting with.
    </p>
